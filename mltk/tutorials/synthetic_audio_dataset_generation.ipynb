    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A quality keyword spotting dataset should have the following characteristics:  \n",
    "- __Lots of samples__ - At least 3k+ samples for each keyword (10-100k+ is recommended)\n",
    "- __Lots of different voices__ - The more people speaking the keywords the better as this will help account of different accents \n",
    "- __Same voice, different pronunciations__ - The same speaker saying the keyword in different ways (e.g. fast, slow, \"happy\", \"sad\", \"excited\", etc.)\n",
    "- __Lots of negative samples__ - Words that are not the keyword(s) but sound similar or would be commonly heard in the field\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these characterisitics help to make a _representative_ dataset, and the more representative the dataset (i.e. the more similar the data is to what would be heard in the field) the better the machine learning model will likely perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recording real people\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, the dataset would be generated by recording 5-50k+ different people saying the keyword(s) as this would help to make the most representative dataset.\n",
    "While 3rd-party services are available to aid with dataset generation they can be expensive ($20k+).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Pros__  \n",
    "- More representative samples\n",
    "\n",
    "__Cons__  \n",
    "- Expensive (time and money)\n",
    "- Harder to generate \"negative\" samples (harder to record non-keywords)\n",
    "- More data cleaning required (need to verify audio samples as humans make errors)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Synthetic generation\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach is to synthetically generate the audio samples using Text-to-Speech (TTS) services.\n",
    "Cloud services like [Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech), [Microsoft Azure (Azure)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/text-to-speech), and [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/polly)\n",
    "allow for converting written text to audio samples. While these services are primarily intended for converting long strings of text they also work for single words.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major concern with this approach is that the generated audio samples would not be representative (i.e. they would sound too \"robotic\"), however, in many cases the audio generated by these TTS services sounds realistic thanks to [new AI techniques](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/12/tacotron-2-generating-human-like-speech.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Pros__  \n",
    "- Less expensive (time and money)\n",
    "- Easier to generate \"negative\" samples\n",
    "- Little or no data cleaning required\n",
    "\n",
    "__Cons__  \n",
    "- Less representative samples (limited by the number of \"voices\" offered by the TTS services)"

    "### Note about synthetic augmentations\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the TTS services allow for augmenting the audio by adjusting the \"pitch\" or \"speaking rate\". While this can help to increase the number of audio samples, these augmentations should be used sparingly as they do not fundamentally change the underlying audio. As such, a large number of samples with small increments in the augmentation settings will likely not help the machine learning model to generalize (in fact, they could cause the ML model to over fit the data)."

    "### Note about languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Each TTS service supports numerous different languages.\n",
    "While there are exceptions, it has been found that English keywords generated with different languages are still valid (e.g. English text generated with a Russian \"voice\" still sounds like a valid English audio sample with a Russian accent).\n",
    "This is very useful as it allows for generating keywords with different accents and thus allows for generating a more representative dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using different languages, it is recommended to spot check the generated audio samples to ensure they're valid."

    "### Note about the \"negative\" class\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a machine learning model to detect a one or more keywords is (relatively) easy.\n",
    "The hard part is training a machine learning model to reliably detect the keywords _and_ reject everything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a \"smart\" trashcan whose lid opens with the keyword \"open\" and closes with the keyword \"close\".\n",
    "The trashcan should only react to those two keywords and ignore all other words and sounds (i.e. it should have a low false-positive rate).\n",
    "For this application, a low false-positive rate is critical otherwise the trashcan lid would be constantly opening/closing while having a conversation next to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Training an ML model to trigger on the \"open\" and \"close\" keywords is fairly simple.\n",
    "The hard part is getting the ML model to ignore everything else (e.g. words like \"opening\", \"closet\", etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "To help solve this problem, the dataset should have a large \"negative\" class -- it should have lots of samples that sound similar to the keywords.\n",
    "Generating the negative samples is fairly trivial with synthetic dataset generation as it is just a matter of supplying the negative keywords to the generation script.\n"

    "|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Standard (non-WaveNet, non-Neural2) voices | 0 to 4 million characters | $0.000004 USD per character ($4.00 USD per 1 million characters)   |\n",
    "| WaveNet voices                             | 0 to 1 million characters | $0.000016 USD per character  ($16.00 USD per 1 million characters) |\n",

    "\n",
    "Even with this pricing, a lot of keyword audio samples may be generated for very little money.\n",
    "\n",
    "__NOTE:__ The number of characters sent is not only dependent on the length of the keyword but also on the audio markup language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, the following is an example request sent to the Microsoft cloud:\n",
